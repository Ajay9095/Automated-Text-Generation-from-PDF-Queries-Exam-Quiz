# Automated-Text-Generation-from-PDF-Queries-Exam-Quiz

This Streamlit application allows users to upload a PDF, ask questions about the content, and generate exam questions (Multiple Choice Questions and Fill-in-the-Blanks) based on the uploaded PDF. It uses LangChain and Hugging Face embeddings to handle text queries and document splitting. The application also integrates ChatGroq for advanced language model processing.

## Features

- Upload PDF and retrieve content-based questions.
- Generate multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions from the uploaded PDF.
- Chat interface to query the PDF for text-based answers.
- Interactive exam with answer validation.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the application:

- `streamlit`
- `os`
- `langchain_groq`
- `langchain_community.document_loaders`
- `langchain_community.vectorstores`
- `langchain.text_splitter`
- `langchain_core.prompts`
- `langchain.chains`
- `langchain_huggingface.embeddings`
- `dotenv`
- `random`
- `time`
- `warnings`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain_groq langchain_community langchain langchain_huggingface python-dotenv
   ```

4. Make sure you have the following environment variables set up in a `.env` file:

   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app by running the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. In the sidebar, upload a PDF file. Once the file is uploaded, the app will process the PDF and split the document into smaller chunks using LangChainâ€™s text splitter.

3. You can interact with two main sections:
   - **Home:** Query the content of the PDF via chat.
   - **Exam:** Generate multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions based on the content of the PDF.

## Key Libraries

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **LangChain**: Used for document loaders, splitting documents, creating prompts, and managing the chain for document retrieval.
- **HuggingFaceEmbeddings**: For generating embeddings from the uploaded PDF content.
- **FAISS**: Vector store used for efficient similarity searches.
- **ChatGroq**: Large language model for handling advanced natural language processing tasks.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables.
